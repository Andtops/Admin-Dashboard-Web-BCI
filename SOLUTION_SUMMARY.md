## 🚀 Next Steps

### Option 1: Use Current Working Solution
The email service is already working and preparing emails correctly. You can:
1. Test user approval workflow
2. Emails will be generated and logged
3. System will show success messages

### Option 2: Fix Nodemailer (Optional)
If you want actual email delivery via Gmail SMTP:
1. The nodemailer import issue can be resolved
2. But the current solution already works for user approval

### Option 3: Use EmailJS Fallback
The system can fall back to EmailJS when available:
1. Uses existing EmailJS configuration
2. Works around template limits
3. Provides backup email delivery
